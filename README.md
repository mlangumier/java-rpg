## Glossary

### Dice Rolls
When you see something like `d6` or `d20`, this means we're using a dice with the corresponding number of sides. Therefore, a `d6` refers to a `6 sided Die`.
> Trivia: Even though the conventional use is: Singular "die", Plural "dice", its uses mostly depend on the context.
