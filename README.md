## Glossary

### Dice Rolls
When you see something like `d6` or `d20`, this means we're using a dice with the corresponding number of sides. Therefore, a `d6` refers to a `6 sided Die`.  
Furthermore, when we use something like `2d6` or `(number)d6`, that mean we roll multiple times the specified dice. Therefore, `2d6` means that we're rolling `two (2)` `six-sided (d6)` dice.
> Trivia: Even though the conventional use is "one **die**, multiple **dice**", its uses mostly depend on the context and personal preferences.
